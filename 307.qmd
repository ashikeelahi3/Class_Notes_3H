# Complex Numbers

## Number and Complex Number

### Number

**Number:** A number is a mathematical objects used to count, measure and also label. The original examples are the natural numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 and so on. A notational symbol that represents a number is called a numeral. In addition, to their use in counting and measuring, numerals are often used for labels (as with telephone numbers), for ordering (as with serial numbers) and for codes (as with ISBNs).

### Complex Number

**Complex number:** A complex number is a number that can be expressed in the form $a+ib$, where `a` and `b` are real numbers and `i` is the imaginary unit satisfying the property that $i^2 = -1$.

If $z=a+ib$, then `a` is called real part and `b` is called the imaginary part of `z`, which are denoted by $Re\{z\}$ and $Im\{z\}$ respectively.

**Example:** 1. $2+5i$, where $a=2,b=5$ 2. $3-i$, where $a=3,b=-1$

Here, 1 and 2 are complex numbers because they can be expressed in the form $a+ib$.

### Complex Variable

**Complex Variable:** If $z=a+ib$ is a complex number satisfying $i^2=-1$, then `a` is called real part of `z` and `b` is called imaginary part of `z`, which are denoted by $Re\{z\}$ and $Im\{z\}$ respectively.

The symbol `z`, which can stand for any complex number, is a complex variable.

**Example:** $z_1 = 2+3i$ and $z_2=5-3i$ Here, $z_1$ and $z_2$ are complex number.

## Real Number

**Real Numbers:** All numbers which are situated on straight line are called real numbers. The set of real numbers is denoted by $\mathbb{R}$ and defined as,

$$\mathbb{R} = \{\text{ Set of Real Numbers }\} = \{\mathbb{Q} \cup \mathbb{Q}' \}$$

**Real Line:** All the numbers positive or negative, rational or irrational can be represented on a straight line, say the axis of x which is called real line.

### Properties of real numbers

1.  Commutative: $a+b = b+a$, $ab = ba$
2.  Associative: $(a+b)+c=a+(b+c)$, $(ab)c=a(bc)$
3.  Distributive: $a(b+c) = ab + ac$, $(a+b)c=ac+bc$
4.  Identity: $a+0=a$, $0+a=a$, $a\cdot1=a$, $1\cdot a = a$

$$\mathbb{Q} = \{\text{ Set of Rational Numbers }\}$$ $$\mathbb{Z} = \{\text{ Set of Integer Numbers }\}$$ $$\mathbb{N} = \{\text{ Set of Natural Numbers }\}$$ $$\mathbb{R} = \{\text{ Set of Real Numbers }\}$$ $$\mathbb{C} = \{\text{ Set of Real Numbers }\}$$

$$\mathbb{N} \subset \mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{R}\subset \mathbb{C}$$
